Pre-requisites:
===============

Lab1: Create a Virtual machine



1. Type ec2 on search box and go to the dashboard'
2. Click on Launch Instance > Launch Instance > Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type > t2.micro > Launch > Create a new Key Pair (Download the KeyPair and Save it to reuse the same for connecting to the machine) > Launch Instance
3. Go to EC2 Dashboard > Instances . Ensure the instance is in running state and then select the instance and click on Connect > EC Instant Connect.


Lab2: Accessing VM

Download putty.zip from GDrive

For Windows Users:

1. Convert pem key file into ppk key file. This can be done using PUTTYGEN.exe

2. OPen Putty.exe and Copy paste the hostname in the Host Name

3. On the left hand side menu, click SSH > Auth.  and set the private key 

4. Click on Connect

5. Username: ec2-user



IAM (Identity Access Management)
=================================

This allows the user to provide access rights to all the objects created in AWS.


Demo: Giving administrator access to the VM to access all services in AWS.

Lab 3: How to create security roles for any AWS object?

IAM -- Identity Access Management

This service in AWS allows admins or users to create a new role or to create access token.

Example: We are going give our AWS instance administrator rights to access and control any AWS service in my account.


1. Go to IAM dashboard
2. On the left hand side menu, click on Access Management > Roles
3. Click on Create Role
4. Select EC2 and click on Next:Permissions
5. Attach the following policies:
	AdministratorAccess
6. Click on Next > Next > Give a name to the role named 'ec2-admin' and ensure policy is attached and click on Create role

7. Ensure the role is listed on the table.


Lab 4: How to attach the role in the object?

1. Go to the appropriate service (EC2 dashboard)
2. Select the machine on which the role is to be attached
3. Click on Actions > Security > Modify IAM role > Select the role > Save



Lab 5: How to use S3 to store data?

Amazon Simple Storage Service ----> Similar to GDrive but you can have a raw storage or you can have a shared storage

Bucket -----> Main Folder in S3
Objects ----> Sub Folder in the main folder or File in S3 bucket


1. Go to S3 dashboard
2. Create a bucket named dataset64675
3. Try creating a folder named transactions
4. Try Uploading a file.
	



Assignment 1
-------------

Create a VM with t2.micro instance template. Ensure the following

	a. Recreate a new key
	b. Convert the key to private key compatible for putty
	c. Convert the key to private key compatible for Winscp
	d. Access the machine using Putty and WinSCP and load data using WinSCP
	e. Ensure you attach Adminsitrator role to the VM.
